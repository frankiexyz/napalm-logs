Napalm-logs
===========

Python library to parse syslog messages from network devices and produce JSON serializable Python objects, in a vendor agnostic shape. The output objects are structured following the OpenConfig or IETF YANG models.

For example, the following syslog message from a Juniper device:

.. code-block:: text

	Mar 30 12:45:19 re0.edge01.bjm01 rpd[15852]: BGP_PREFIX_THRESH_EXCEEDED 1.2.3.4 (External AS 15169): Configured maximum prefix-limit threshold(160) exceeded for inet-unicast nlri: 181 (instance master)


Will produce the following object:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "ip": "172.17.17.1",
    "host": "edge01.bjm01",
    "message_details": {

                      }

                    "ipv4-unicast": {
                      "prefix-limit": {
                        "state": {

                        }
                      }
                    },
                    "afi-safi-name": "inet"
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "timestamp": "1490877919"
  }


Thie library is provided with a command line program which acts as a daemon, running in background and listening to syslog messages continuously, then publishing them over secured channels, where multiple clients can subscribe.

It is flexible to listen to the syslog messages via UDP or TCP, but also from brokers such as Apache Kafka. Similarly, the output objects can be published via various channels such as ZeroMQ, Kafka, or remote server logging. It is also pluggable enough to extend these capabilities and listen or publish to other services, depending on the needs.

The messages are published over a secured channel, encrypted and signed. Although the security can be disabled, this is highly discouraged.

Install
-------
napalm-logs is available on PyPi and can easily be installed using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install napalm-logs

How to use napalm-logs
----------------------
Basic Configuration
+++++++++++++++++++
Firstly you need to decide if you would like all messages between napalm-logs and the clients to be encrypted.

If you do want them to be encrypted you will require a certificate and key, which you can generate using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    openssl req -nodes -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout /var/cache/napalm-logs.key -out /var/cache/napalm-logs.crt -days 365

This will provide a self-signed certificate ``napalm-logs.crt`` and key ``napalm-logs.key`` under the ``/var/cache`` directory.

If you do not require the messages to be encrypted you can ignore the above step and just use the command line argument ``--disable-security`` when starting napalm-logs.

Each of the other config options come with defaults, so you can now start napalm-logs with default options and your chosen security options.

Starting napalm-logs
++++++++++++++++++++
Napalm-logs will need to be run with root privileges if you want it to be able to listen on ``udp`` port ``514`` - the standard syslog port. If you need to run it via sudo and it has been installed in a virtual env, you will need to include the full path. In these examples I will run as root.

To start napalm-logs using the crt and key generated above you should run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    napalm-logs --certificate /var/cache/napalm-logs.crt --keyfile /var/cache/napalm-logs.key

This will start napalm-logs listening for incoming syslog messages on ``0.0.0.0`` port ``514``. It will also start to listen for incoming client requests on ``0.0.0.0`` port ``49017``, and incoming authentication requests on ``0.0.0.0`` port ``49018``. For more information on authentication please see the authentication section.

Further Configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++

It is possible to change the address and ports that napalm-logs will use, lets take a look at these options:

.. code-block:: bash

	  -a ADDRESS, --address=ADDRESS
							Listener address. Default: 0.0.0.0
	  -p PORT, --port=PORT  Listener bind port. Default: 514
	  --publish-address=PUBLISH_ADDRESS
							Publisher bind address. Default: 0.0.0.0
	  --publish-port=PUBLISH_PORT
							Publisher bind port. Default: 49017
	  --auth-address=AUTH_ADDRESS
							Authenticator bind address. Default: 0.0.0.0
	  --auth-port=AUTH_PORT
							Authenticator bind port. Default: 49018

There are several ``plugable`` parts to napalm-logs, two of which are the ``listener`` and the ``publisher``. The listener is the part that ingests the incoming syslog messages, and the publisher is the part that outputs them to the client.

You can chose which listener to use, and which publisher to use by using the following arguments:

.. code-block:: bash

	  --listener=LISTENER   Listener type. Default: udp
	  -t TRANSPORT, --transport=TRANSPORT
							Publish transport. Default: zmq

There are more configuration options, please see :ref:`configuration-options` for more details.

Configuration file example
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The napalm-logs server can be started without any CLI aguments, as long as they are correctly specified under the configuration file. The default path of the configuration file is under ``/etc/napalm/logs``. To select a different filepath, we can use the ``-c`` option:

.. code-block:: bash

	napalm-logs -c /home/admin/napalm/logs

The configuration file is formatted as YAML, which makes it more human readable. In general, any configuration option available on the CLI can be specified in the configuration file, with the mention that hyphen is replaced by underscore, e.g.: the CLI option ``auth-address`` becomes ``auth_address`` in the napalm-logs configuration file.

.. code-block:: yaml

    address: 172.17.17.1
    port: 5514
    publish_address: 172.17.17.2
    publish_port: 49017
    publisher: zmq
    listener:
      kafka:
        bootstrap_servers:
          - 10.10.10.1
          - 10.10.10.2:1234
          - srv1.kafka.as1234.net
          - srv2.kafka.as1234.net:17171

The configuration above listenes to the syslog messages from the Kafka bootstrap servers ``10.10.10.1``, ``10.10.10.2`` and ``10.10.10.3`` then publishes the structured objects encrypted and serialized via ZeroMQ, serving them at the address ``172.17.17.2``, port ``49017``.

Check the complete list of configuration options under :ref:`configuration-options`.

Starting a Client
+++++++++++++++++

The client structure depends on how you start the napalm-logs daemon. If the security is disabled (via the CLI option ``--disable-security`` or through the configuration file, where the ``disable_security`` field is set as ``false``), the client script is as simple as:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import zmq
    import napalm_logs.utils

    server_address = '127.0.0.1'
    server_port = 49017

    context = zmq.Context()
    socket = context.socket(zmq.SUB)
    socket.connect('tcp://{address}:{port}'.format(address=server_address,
                                                   port=server_port))
    socket.setsockopt(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, '')

    while True:
        raw_object = socket.recv()
        print(napalm_logs.utils.unserialize(raw_object))

Which subscribes to the ZeroMQ bus and deserializes messages using the ``napalm_logs.utils.unserialise`` helper. The ``server_address`` and the ``server_port`` of the client represent the ``--publish-address`` and the ``--publish-port`` of the napalm-logs daemon.

When the program is started with security enabled (**recommended**), the clients can use the ``napalm_logs.utils.ClientAuth`` class, which executes the handshake to retrieve the encryption key and hex of the verification key. This class requires the certificate (the same certificate specified when starting the napalm-logs daemon), as well as the authentication address and port (corresponding to the ``--auth-address`` and ``--auth-port`` CLI arguments or ``auth_address`` and ``auth_port`` configuration fields sent to the napalm-logs daemon):

.. code-block:: python

	#!/usr/bin/env python

	import napalm_logs.utils
	import zmq

	server_address = '127.0.0.1'
	server_port = 49017
	auth_address = '127.0.0.1'
	auth_port = 49018

	certificate = '/var/cache/napalm-logs.crt' # This is the server crt generated earlier

	context = zmq.Context()
	socket = context.socket(zmq.SUB)
	socket.connect('tcp://{address}:{port}'.format(address=server_address,
	                                               port=server_port))
	socket.setsockopt(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, '')

	auth = napalm_logs.utils.ClientAuth(certificate,
	                                    address=auth_address,
	                                    port=auth_port)

	while True:
	    raw_object = socket.recv()
	    decrypted = auth.decrypt(raw_object)
	    print(decrypted)
